I don't know what I was doing when I made this. I was a sophomore in high school and was going on about 5 hours of sleep a night.
# Usability
* I don't remember using makefiles but there was something in there about using makefiles. I believe all you need to do (for the more complicated things that require makefiles) is type the word "make" in the terminal.
* This was designed to be used the way I used this, which was in the terminal. I used vim and bash.
* The input and output files are provided, with weird naming stuff like o3a3 meaning "output 3 assignment 3".
